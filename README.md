As we're all aware, online payments have become an integral part of our daily lives. Banking institutions offer various ways to manage our finances, with online payments being a significant feature. However, these payments come in diverse types, aiming to enhance customer satisfaction, but they also bring along several drawbacks, particularly related to fraudulent activities. Given this scenario, our analysis delves into determining whether an online payment is potentially fraudulent. With a dataset comprising 1,048,576 rows and 11 attributes capturing information such as old balance, new balance post-transaction, and the payment mode, we aim to accomplish eight key objectives. These objectives will demonstrate how this analysis aids in understanding and identifying fraudulent payments. To achieve these goals effectively, we'll be leveraging a wide array of technical resources.
